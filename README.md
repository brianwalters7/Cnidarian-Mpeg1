# Cnidarian-Mpeg1
Cnidarian Mpeg1 protein sequences used to analyze gene diversity
BLASTp (Version 2.2.29+) searches using the Mus musculus Perforin-2 protein sequence identified homolog candidates in eighteen species of cnidaria and one porifera
Phylogenetic analysis using candidate homologs from the BLAST search, as well as the M. musculus and Homo sapiens sequences, was performed in MEGAX (Version 10.1.7). 
Homolog alignment was created using multiple sequence alignment by log-expectation (MUSCLE) in MEGAX and cleaned manually. 
The candidate group was further narrowed during alignment if the sequence was inconsistent with the length of  the M. musculus reference. 
A neighbor joining tree was created using 95% partial deletion and 1000 bootstrap replicates (Figure 1A).
